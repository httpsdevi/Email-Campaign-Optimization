web: gunicorn app:app --log-file -

Explanation:

web:: This tells the hosting platform (like Heroku or Render) that this is a web process.

gunicorn: This is a production-ready Python WSGI HTTP server. It's much more robust for serving Flask applications in a production environment than Flask's built-in development server.

app:app: This specifies that Gunicorn should run the app instance (the second app) found within the app.py file (the first app).

--log-file -: This tells Gunicorn to send its logs to standard output, which is how most cloud platforms collect logs.
